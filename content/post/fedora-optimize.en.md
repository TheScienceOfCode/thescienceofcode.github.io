A practical guide to improve your experience with Fedora Linux optimizing your startup times and gaming performance.
<!--more-->

This guide applies for both **KDE** and **Gnome** flavors of Fedora Linux including versions **Fedora 36** and **Fedora 37**. Specially built for desktop users including those who play on Linux through Steam Proton, Native Games or via launchers like Lutris.

## Startup optimization

We will start disabling some stuff that is not required for a desktop use case: 

1. Optimize startup by masking systemd-udev-settle:

   ```
   sudo systemctl mask systemd-udev-settle
   ```

   Why disable this? [More info](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-udev-settle.service.html)

2. Optimize startup by disabling NetworkManager-wait-online.service:

    ```
    sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
    ```

    Why disable this? [More info](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1018576/what-does-networkmanager-wait-online-service-do)

3. **For KDE**: disable check for updates at startup.

   ```
   sudo mkdir /etc/xdg/autostart.disabled
   sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/org.kde.discover.notifier.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart.disabled/org.kde.discover.notifier.desktop
   ```

   You may need to re-apply this commands after some system updates that restore some KDE settings to defaults.

   In case that youâ€™ve wanted to go back, just restore the files from the backup directory autostart.disabled. 


## Gaming optimization

* Start games using **GameMode**:

  * Edit the Steam launch options for the game:

    ```
    gamemoderun %command%
    ```

  * For others, you must manually request GameMode when running the game. This can be done by launching the game through gamemoderun:

    ```
    gamemoderun ./game
    ```

  * For games/launchers which integrate GameMode support (like **Lutris**) simply running the game will automatically activate GameMode. [More info](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode).

* **On KDE** you may experience some stuttering and/or bad reposiveness while playing fullscreen games, just **disable** the **Compositor** to boost your gaming experience:

   You can re-enable it manually or install the KWin script [Autocomposer](https://store.kde.org/p/1502826) that handles the entire process automatically.

## Extra tips

* Install additional codecs:

  ```
  sudo dnf groupupdate multimedia --setop="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin
  sudo dnf groupupdate sound-and-video
  ```

* **On KDE**: Enable Dolphin video previews:

  ```
  sudo dnf install ffmpegthumbs
  ```

* **On KDE**: Disable calendar reminder:

  ```
  cp /etc/xdg/autostart/org.kde.kalendarac.desktop ~/.config/autostart
  ```

  Open the file *~/.config/autostart* and modify it, replacing this line:

  ```python
  X-KDE-autostart-condition=kalendaracrc:General:Autostart:true
  ```

  With the following line:

  ```python
  X-KDE-autostart-condition=kalendaracrc:General:Autostart:false
  ```

Welcome to this quick guide for those interested in getting started with **Dear ImGui** using **Linux** and **Windows**.
<!--more-->

**Dear ImGui** is a library written in **C++** (integrated with C, C#, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Go, etc), that enables programmers to build user interfaces in a quick and simple manner, allowing fast iteration times during development. In the words of its own developers:

> "It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries (...) is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on console platforms where operating system features are non-standard."

# Quick guide to create a project with Dear ImGui

## Pre-requisites

* Git knowledge.
* Programming knowledge (intermediate level).
* C/C++ knowledge.

## Quick overview

Before starting, it may be illustrative to take a look at the main code of the example, as well as the final result it produces:

![dear imgui linux windows](/images/posts/dear-imgui-quickstart-demo.png)

```cpp
// 1. Show the big demo window (Most of the sample code is in ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()! You can browse its code to learn more about Dear ImGui!).
if (show_demo_window)
    ImGui::ShowDemoWindow(&show_demo_window);

// 2. Show a simple window that we create ourselves. We use a Begin/End pair to create a named window.
{
    static float f = 0.0f;
    static int counter = 0;

    ImGui::Begin("Hello, world!");                          // Create a window called "Hello, world!" and append into it.

    ImGui::Text("This is some useful text.");               // Display some text (you can use a format strings too)
    ImGui::Checkbox("Demo Window", &show_demo_window);      // Edit bools storing our window open/close state
    ImGui::Checkbox("Another Window", &show_another_window);

    ImGui::SliderFloat("float", &f, 0.0f, 1.0f);            // Edit 1 float using a slider from 0.0f to 1.0f
    ImGui::ColorEdit3("clear color", (float*)&clear_color); // Edit 3 floats representing a color

    if (ImGui::Button("Button"))                            // Buttons return true when clicked (most widgets return true when edited/activated)
        counter++;
    ImGui::SameLine();
    ImGui::Text("counter = %d", counter);

    ImGui::Text("Application average %.3f ms/frame (%.1f FPS)", 1000.0f / io.Framerate, io.Framerate);
    ImGui::End();
}

// 3. Show another simple window.
if (show_another_window)
{
    ImGui::Begin("Another Window", &show_another_window);   // Pass a pointer to our bool variable (the window will have a closing button that will clear the bool when clicked)
    ImGui::Text("Hello from another window!");
    if (ImGui::Button("Close Me"))
        show_another_window = false;
    ImGui::End();
}
```  

As you can see, it is a simple and compact code, especially compare it against other APIs or libraries to create user interfaces. For more information, at the end of the tutorial we leave the link to the official **Dear ImGui** repository, which contains more documentation about the library.


## Quick start

> We will use the official **Dear ImGui** example [glfw-opengl3](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples/example_glfw_opengl3) as base.

1. Create a new Git repository.

2. Inside the repo use the following command to add **ImGui** as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules):

   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git 
   ```

3. Create a file named [main.cpp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacanizares/imgui-test/master/main.cpp) (link has file contents). This file contains the code that we've reviewed previously and additional instructions to create a window with **GLFW**.

### Linux

1. Create a file named [Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacanizares/imgui-test/master/Makefile) (link has file contents).

2. Install **GLFW Development** library, depending on your distribution this may vary, for example:

   * Fedora:

     ```
     sudo dnf install glfw-devel     
     ```

   * Ubuntu:

     ```
     apt-get install libglfw-dev     
     ```

3. Execute **make** while in the project root. Inside **bin/** we will find the compiled executable.

### Windows

1. Create a file named [imgui-test.vcxproj](https://github.com/dacanizares/imgui-test/blob/master/imgui-test.vcxproj) (link has file contents).

2. Download [GLFW 64-bit pre-compiled binaries for Windows](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/download/3.3.8/glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64.zip). Open zip file inside the folder *glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64* and extract contents in the project folder **win-libs/glfw**  (create any missing folders). In the end, it should look like this:

![project library folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dacanizares/imgui-test/master/.images/glfw-folder.png)

Project is configured to run with Visual Studio 2022, in case that you want to use another version, edit **imgui-test.vcxproj** (searching for *vc2022* and replacing it with any of the available versions, as seen in the previous image).

3. Open the project with Visual Studio and run it.

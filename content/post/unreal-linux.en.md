Complete guide to start using **Unreal Engine** on your **Linux** machine. Compatible with **UE5** and its latest version **UE5.1**.
<!--more-->

Unreal Engine is an amazing tool to create videogames and compile them for almost any (capable) device out there. Despite the fact that Unreal is an awesome **multiplatform** engine, trying to run its **editor** on Linux can be obscure and troublesome. This is a compact but comprehensive guide that includes instructions to install, execute and troubleshoot **UE 5 for Linux**.

![unreal linux](/images/posts/unreal-linux.png)

# Quick start

1. Download the [official binaries](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux). They may work with almost any distribution, if you have problems see [Building Unreal Engine](#building-unreal-engine) to compile your own version of the engine.

2. Extract Unreal Engine on any location, for example:

    ```
    # It's a good idea to create a folder per VERSION
    $HOME/Unreal/VERSION/

    # Example
    $HOME/Unreal/5.1.0/
    ```

3. Go inside the extracted folder **Engine/Binaries/Linux** and execute the file: **UnrealEditor**. You should see the Unreal Engine Editor just working.

4. Open or create a project. After that you will be able to open your project with your IDE (if it has C++ code) and compile it as usual. We recommend [Rider Linux](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=linux) as IDE because it offers the best development experience for Unreal C++.

## Recommended configuration

Optionally, you can configure the build process to use the maximum power of your CPU. Follow these steps:

1. Configure **max build parallel actions** modifying or creating the following file:

   ```
   $HOME/.config/Unreal Engine/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml
   ```

2. Set the contents of the file, accordingly to your CPU specifications, for example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

   <Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">

   <ParallelExecutor>
      <MaxProcessorCount>30</MaxProcessorCount>
      <ProcessorCountMultiplier>2</ProcessorCountMultiplier>
      <!-- Free memory per action in bytes, used to limit the number of 
        parallel actions if the machine is memory starved. 
        Set to 0 to disable free memory checking.
        PROCEED WITH CAUTION -->
      <MemoryPerActionBytes>0</MemoryPerActionBytes>
    </ParallelExecutor>

    </Configuration>
    ```

In the previous example, by setting **ProcessorCountMultiplier to 2**, the build process takes into account logical threads (if your CPU supports *Simultaneous Multi Threading (SMT)* or *hyper-threading*) to calculate the max actions to execute in parallel. Then, setting **MaxProcessorCount to 30** limits the compile thread count to 30. So if your CPU has 16 physical cores and 2 logical cores each (32 in total), this leaves 2 logical cores entirely free for other software, resulting in a smoother experience when multitasking during project compilation. *This can change depending on your available RAM if you do not set **MemoryPerActionBytes** to 0, but doing that can eventually crash your system.*

If your settings have been configured properly, you will get the following UE build process output:

```
Building XXX actions with 30 processes...
```

## Common issues

* **I have VSCodium instead of VSCode (or any other IDE):** just try to create a new C++ project and disable VSCode when Unreal asks for it.

* **Could not locate the assembly "Ionic.Zip.Reduced":** go to your **Engine/Binaries/DotNet/UnrealBuildTool** and locate the file **Ionic.Zip.Reduced**, duplicate that file into the parent folder **Engine/Binaries/DotNet/**.

* **Unreal Startup is extremely slow with a C++ project:** run (NOT debug) the project. Use debug mode only when you require to actually *debug the code*. It is a little bit unconfortable but your project will load pretty fast.


# Building Unreal Engine

To compile and generate your own binaries of **Unreal Engine**, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your GitHub account to see the repo: [See this guide](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github)

2. Clone or download from: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine).

3. After downloading, execute **Setup.sh**:

   ```sh
   ./Setup.sh
   ```

3. Generate files (but do not *make*, to avoid recompiling twice).

   ```sh
   ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh

   # Do not execute this command 
   # make
   ```

4. Go to **Engine/Build/BatchFiles/**, and execute the following command:

   ```sh
   /RunUAT.sh BuildGraph -target="Make Installed Build Linux" -script=Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml -clean -set:HostPlatformOnly=true -set:WithDDC=false -set:GameConfigurations="Development;Shipping"
   ```

   *If there are errors with dependencies*: Copy **Engine/Binaries/DotNET** (from source folders) the output path  **LocalBuilds/Engine/Linux/Engine/Binaries/DotNET**. Re-run previous command.

6. Copy the results from **LocalBuilds/Engine/Linux** folder to any other location.

7. Open the editor executable, located at: **{any other location}/Engine/Binaries/Linux/UnrealEditor**.

## Common errors

* Dependencies errors:
  * **Could not locate the assembly "Ionic.Zip.Reduced":** go to your **Engine/Binaries/DotNet/UnrealBuildTool** and locate the file **Ionic.Zip.Reduced**, duplicate that file into the parent folder **Engine/Binaries/DotNet/**.
